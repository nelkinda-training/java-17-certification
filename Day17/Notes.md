# Notes

- Semaphore Example:
    Limit parallel access to a resource, for example, a downstream service that allows only a limited number of parallel client connections.

- Countdown Latch Example:
    Continue once a number of threads completed their work.

- CyclicBarrier:
    Like a Countdown latch, but can be re-used.
